1. Modeled a flexible Branch Predictor - for Bimodal, Gshare, and Hybrid configurations utilizing a 2-bit Smith Counter and a Branch History
Predictor storing information about previously seen branches.
2. Compared design trade-offs in terms of misprediction rates using SPECâ€™s Benchmark trace files (2 million traces)
